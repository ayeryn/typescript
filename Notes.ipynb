    "## Why Learn TS?\n",
    "1. Confidence\n",
    "   - App-crashing runtime errors are dramatically reduced by TS, which checks the code at compile time before it ever gets deployed.\n",
    "2. Productivity\n",
    "   - Using TS \"turns on\" a number of neat features that make your life as a developer a LOT easier\n",
    "   - Autocomplete, refactoring capacilities, immediate error checking, and more, all greatly improve the developer experience (DX)\n",
    "3. Employability\n",
    "   - TS is considered \"table stakes\" by many companies, even if it isn't explicitly listed in job descriptions\n",
    "   - Knowing even a little TS can set you apart from other junior developer candidates\n"
